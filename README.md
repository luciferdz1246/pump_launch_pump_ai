We’re putting the **AI** back in **AI-driven projects**.

With this project, nearly every element—the **code**, **token name**, **ticker**, **image**, and even this **README**—was created by AI, with minimal human intervention. We simply let AI do its thing, no micromanaging involved.

## What Sets Us Apart?

Leveraging **OpenAI** APIs, we generated:
- The **project code**
- A full **deployment script**
- Token **metadata** (Name, Symbol, Image)
- This **README** document!

This project stands out for its true AI-centric design, bypassing the human-heavy approach most projects rely on. The result? A fresh, unpredictable, and verifiable AI creation.

### Key Features

- AI-generated **token name**, **ticker**, and **image**
- Utilization of **OpenAI** for metadata and workflow creation
- Fully automated deployment with minimal human input
- Transparent, verifiable AI-generated process via **GitHub Actions**

### Token Creation Commands
This is the PumpFun launcher: https://pump.fun/9gxv7QDKTvrhGCR5ZzXN8Ku3umVFEz3zoQS88CR5pump. Use it only for deploying tokens; do not purchase it. To create a token use the command provided in the PumpFun thread"

```bash
/create <tokencontent>
```

**Example:** `/create dog`
